# H3N2Emergence

On the basis of these preliminarily identified emerging variants, we developed a Bayesian model to infer the temporal and spatial origins of H3N2 antigenic variants. For a specific drift event, the Bayesian model was constructed upon the conditional dependency that T\~ZN(T_0,σ^2 )+(1-Z)(αN_+ (T_1,σ^2 )+(1-α) N_- (T_2,σ^2 )), D\~ZN(D_1,δ^2 )+(1-Z)N(D_2,δ^2 ) and Z\~Bern(p_0 ), where each virus within this drift contains a location L, time T (ranging in [T_1,T_2 ]), and an antigenic difference D (with hyper-parameters D_1 and D_2) between its distances to the two antigenic cluster centers in the drift; N, N_+, and N_- denote the normal distribution and two truncated normal distributions; Bern denotes the Bernoulli distribution; α, σ, and δ are hyper-parameters; and, for each virus, Z is a potential binary variable indicating whether the virus is a beginning point of an emergence event. The results for the temporal and spatial origins of an influenza A(H3N2) virus antigenic variant was further validated by using phylogenetic analyses to ensure the temporal and spatial information of the precursor viruses inferred for a testing H3N2 antigenic variant were consistent with those detected by the Bayesian model.
